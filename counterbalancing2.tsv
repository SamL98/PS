The judge earns a good amount for his judicial duties but donates the majority of it.“I do fine with that amount; I have to do fine because there are many who live with much less,” Walker told the paper. He focuses his giving on helping the poor and small entrepreneurs.“This is a matter of freedom,” Walker said. “If you don’t have many possessions then you don’t need to work all your life like a slave to sustain them, and therefore you have more time for yourself.”Walker also seems intent on impressing his philanthropic ways on other’s around the area.Walker espoused his philosophy on poverty and consumption.“If all I’m doing is working to buy things to get more, if society of consumption is the energy of everything, where does this go?” he asked. “We need to start to fight for another kind of culture. ... a poor person is not someone who doesn’t have very much, but the person who really is poor is the person that continues to need more and more and more and desires more and more.”	TheBusinessJournal	Whitepages
1	vote1	James	Walker	Real	Mobile	P2	Judge receives award - Outstanding judicial service and support for youth recognized	Court Judge James Walker thought he was just doing his job when he was awarded for outstanding judicial services, recently."I thought I was doing what I was supposed to because that's my job. I didn't know that people were paying attention or that what I was doing was anything above or beyond or extraordinary," Walker said. "I'm honored."     Walker, who was the recipient of the 2010 Robert J. Kinsey Award, said he did not know about the award until about a week before it was to be presented to him in April. He didn't even know he had been nominated.    The award is presented to judges who show dedication and support to children and youth. Walker has shown his dedication by devoting time to being a member of the Advisory Council, the Court Management Committee, the Judge's Association, American Bar Association, State Bar Association and the Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges.    He has been instrumental in bringing the Youth Center to the community while also helping plan and develop the CASA Program and a community service work program for juveniles.    "I was very touched that everyone went through all that trouble," Walker said. "I couldn't do what I did without my staff and the probation office and a lot of other people — the CASA volunteers, attorneys who represent the kids and their parents," he said.  	TheHerald	PeopleFinder

The incident was completely caught on security camera footage.Judge David Walker was backing out of his parking spot Sunday night and was clearly not paying attention. His car ran over a shoppers grocery cart and knocked over all of their groceries.Rather than getting out to make sure that the person was okay, he sped off to avoid the conflict. The cart went flying and food went everywhere. The person fell to the ground very hard and showed obvious signs of discomfort.“I can’t believe that this happened,” the victim said. “He ran over all of my groceries, who’s going to pay for the food that I lost? I’m lucky that I didn’t get hit by the car and only fell over.”The judge’s car suffered a few minor scratches and dents. He is seeking for damages payments from the person that he struck with his car. The victim was not injured and no word has been given on if the victim will file charges or not. There has also been no word on if the grocery shopper will pay.	TheAdvocate	USSearch

This motorcyclist was Judge David Walker.Walker made claims that the police officer hit him with his car and didn’t help. If this allegation is true the police officer would definitely face some sort of consequence; however, evidence shows that maybe Walker was at fault.Footage of the incident appears to show the judge suddenly falling to the ground when the car was barely moving, prompting accusations he faked the incident.In the video, the officer’s car can be seen inching forward when the judge, David Walker, appears to step into its path and then dramatically fall to the ground.Walker was taken from the scene on a stretcher, wearing a neck brace.There is no word on why the judge faked the incident and what he was trying to do. Video of the incident has been widely shared on social media and has spawned a number of parodies. Walker’s character has really taken a hit because of the backlash.	TheTribune	PeopleGuide
1	vote1	David	Walker	Lure	Mobile	N3	Judge gave away his adopted child, and the tragedy that followed	The sisters were supposed to be moving out of neglect and chaos and into the stability of their forever home. For one of those girls, however, Judge David Walker’s house came to represent something very different: a temporary stopping point on the way to some place much worse.A series of stories revealed that Walker put two young girls he adopted in the care of a man who later sexually abused one of them.More shocking still: What Walker did, unofficially giving away an adopted child, is not illegal in his home state. It is known as “rehoming,” a name that describes a practice more common in pet adoption. The practice is highly controversial — “a monstrous act,” according to adoption advocate John M. Simmons. “There’s probably no greater trauma than thinking you have found a forever family and finding that’s not the case,” said Sandy Santana, interim executive director of Children’s Rights.Walker placed the blame on the state health services department, which, he said, refused to help. State officials also did not act when they learned that the Walker had given the girls to another family, according to the Times, until it was too late. Walker said after harming family pets and threats to hurt the family including his three adopted sons, he again reached out to DHS for help, and where he said “we were then threatened with possible abandonment charges and potentially losing our own boys,” Walker said.

Walker later confronted the man, Joseph Keshav (25), and demanded information on what the couple was doing, the report said.When Keshav indicated that his connection with the woman was none of Walker’s concern, the judge allegedly slapped Keshav and soon Walker’s associates joined in. A passerby quickly alerted the police, who arrived at the spot and took both Walker and Keshav to the police station, it says.Walker claimed that he asked the couple to leave for their own safety in the wake of the reports of molestation. The judge also alleged that he was acting in self-defense as Keshav tried to attack him, the report states.On the other hand, Keshav told the police that he was dropping off his friend, who is the judge’s neighbor. Keshav said that after parking his bike, he was talking to his friend when the judge intervened in their conversation, the report adds.	TheUnionTimes	PeopleSmart

They came in response to an open-ended feature in which local figures were asked about their hopes for 2017. “Henderson catches mad cow disease after being caught having relations with a Herford,” said Mr. Taylor, who is running for re-election, making an apparent reference to the Hereford cattle breed. He said he hoped the disease killed the judge.Asked what he most wanted to see “go away” in the New Year, Mr. Taylor — who has a reputation for speaking in an unfiltered manner - answered, “Mrs. Henderson.”“I’d like her to return to being a male and let loose in the outback of Zimbabwe where she lives comfortably in a cave with Maxie, the gorilla,” he said.Condemnation of the remarks was swift on social media and among elected officials around the state.

It happened during a video presentation Friday.The judge had to be awakened by the clerk after the lights were turned back on in the courtroom. The defense attorney said it wasn't the first time. The judge said he understood, but had not missed any part of testimony.It is concerning to many that the judge has fallen asleep in court more than once; it shows that he is disinterested.Others are concerned that the judge will miss important testimony, and therefore won’t be able to make a fair judgment on the case.“Imagine if an umpire were to just fall asleep in the middle of the World Series!” said a citizen. “You cannot perform to the best of your ability if you’re falling asleep on the job; it just is not acceptable in my opinion.”Many are calling the judge lazy and are demanding for an apology and for him to re-do the trial. Taylor isn’t cooperating and says that he didn’t miss any part of the case.	TheUnionTimes	PeopleSmart

He told interviewers he found cataract surgery to be a productive alternative to the chaos of being a judge. Taylor joined six eye surgeons who restored vision to dozens of impoverished Haitians, many living for years in blindness because of ailments such as cataracts that are easily treated in the United States. Taylor’s second annual journey to the third world went as smoothly as could be hoped. A videographer accompanied him. Reporters from NBC News, the Associated Press, IJReview, and the Washington Post were invited to monitor the surgeries and interview Taylor, under the condition that nothing be published until the senator had left the country. Taylor was happy for the work. "There are things I love about trying to spread the message about the underpinnings of what makes our country great," he said in an interview. "But it's more of an indirect result. Medicine is a direct result. You are working with a team, you have a goal, you execute it, and you get close to people.

They also reaffirmed their claim that he lied to the commission about the thousands of texts he exchanged with the intern. The JTC reviewed their recommendation at the behest of the state Supreme Court and the choice to remand came after Clark and his attorney filed a motion arguing that email evidence beneficial to his case was not presented in March 2015 court proceedings. "The Commission REAFFIRMS its prior findings of fact and further REAFFIRMS its recommendation that Respondent's misconduct warrants removal from judicial office." "I'm disappointed in their decision that they've made, but more by the process -- or (what) some have determined a lack of process -- to achieve that decision," Clark said. "I'm certainly disappointed by the lack of the examination regarding the conduct of the examiner." He said claims by Clark's attorney, Kenneth Mogill, that the nondisclosure was racially motivated were unsubstantiated.	TheAdvocate	USSearch

People are having issue with this due to the precedent that this might set.

2	vote2	Thomas	Clark	Real	Mobile	N16	Judge fined over crash that injured 17-year-old	The public prosecutor found Judge Thomas Clark guilty of driving while incapacitated and causing bodily harm through negligent driving in a judgment published on Monday.Clark, who was campaigning for re-election, was driving his Mercedes coupe towards Shelbyville on September 10th when the car drifted across the central line and collided head-on with a scooter coming in the opposite direction.The 17-year-old driver of the scooter suffered serious injuries, including fractures to both legs.The investigation concluded that Clark’s car drifted across the road because he was fatigued due to sleep apnea, the prosecutor said in a statement.However the judge should have known he was tired because his vehicle's brake-assist function and lane departure warning had been activated several times on the journey, it said.Prosecutors arrived at that conclusion after monitoring images from the vehicle's dashboard camera.As a result of the crash Clark suspended his election campaign “out of respect” for the victim.He was also forced to defend his behavior following the accident, which was criticized by some media outlets.The father of the victim said Clark did not stop immediately after the accident, but 300 meters down the road.When he did return to the scene, he didn't try to speak with the girl's father, who was by then present at the scene.

Clark got the idea for the “blessing box” after seeing a similar project on social media. A friend of his built the structure, and he and his son painted it and set the post in the ground.The next step was to fill it. Clark said he added canned vegetables, fruits, salmon and tuna to the box along with soups, rice, oatmeal, and cereal and boxed milk. He also included toothbrushes, toothpaste, floss, tampons and menstrual pads.Clark then put a sign on the box that reads, “Take a blessing when you need one. Leave blessing when you can.” And that’s exactly what happened.Since the “blessing box” went up in their yard, Clark and his family have seen people take food and other products from the box, including a hungry family on Christmas Eve.“They were all bundled up, backpacks and all,” Clark told the news. “Love that the food was available, but crushed me to see them walk away in those conditions.They have also seen things added to the box like money, food and thank-you notes. 	TheBusinessJournal	Whitepages

2	vote2	Walter	Clark	Lure	Mobile	P15	Judge saves witness’ life in county courthouse	A judge saved a man’s life in his courtroom Thursday morning, performing CPR after the victim suffered a heart attack.The victim was testifying at the trial of an alleged trespasser when he started “gasping for air,” his friend George told ARLnow.com. George, who declined to give his last name or his friend’s name, alerted Judge Walter Clark, who cleared out the courtroom and came down from the bench to render aid.When it became apparent that the victim was having a heart attack, Clark laid him on the floor and started performing chest compressions, George said. Sheriff’s deputies Edwin Hill and Phyllis Henderson assisted Clark and performed mouth-to-mouth, according to Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman Maj. Susie Doyel.“It was a flash, [Clark] was down off that bench in a hurry,” George said. “When I got to the hospital, the EMTs stabilized him and said whoever performed CPR on him probably saved his life.”George and the heart attack victim are childhood friends, and the victim’s house was allegedly broken into recently, which is why they were in court.Between the time Clark began administering CPR and paramedics arrived, George said the victim began breathing and regained his pulse — but then his heart stopped again, prompting the hero judge and deputies to begin CPR again.

2	vote2	Walter	Clark	Lure	Mobile	P16	Judge Clark to serve food at Daily Bread Soup Kitchen	To raise awareness about the importance of community food pantries and soup kitchens, Judge Walter Clark will be serving lunch at the Daily Bread Soup Kitchen. This isn’t a first time occurrence for Judge Clark. He often attends the Daily Bread Soup kitchen to provide whatever help is necessary. Clark said, “I realize I have been blessed in my life, and this is just one way for me to give back to my community.” Clark is currently participating in the SNAP Challenge to experience what life is like for millions of low-income Americans living on an average daily allowance of $4.40. However, often due to stigma surrounding soup kitchens, many Americans don’t often seek out the help they can receive due to pride or other personal reasons. Judge Clark advocates on a large scale to other communities to reduce this stigma, as it is there to benefit all those in need of a hot meal. Regardless of the stigma, with the recent market and prices of food and gas ever increasing, more and more Americans are relying on soup kitchens to provide nourishment for their day. Clark said, “Many of our neighbors are experiencing difficult times and rely on area soup kitchens to receive a decent meal.” Even with all of Clark’s effort, due to the budget impasse, soup kitchens in the area are left no choice but to close their doors. The Daily Bread Soup Kitchen will be attempting to serve additional families without additional funding.	TheEnquirer	zoominfo

Judge Derek Mosley needed a lifesaving kidney transplant, when fellow Judge Brian Miller stepped forward, reports CBS News correspondent Jericka Duncan.There were plenty of hugs to greet 46-year-old Mosley as he retook the bench Monday for the first time since the surgery.“It’s good to be back, let’s do some business,” Mosley said. He had one person to thank —Judge Miller.“I have a part of my best friend in me, that I feel, that I can actually touch, inside of me that keeps me alive,” Mosley said.In 2014, it became clear Mosley’s kidneys were failing. Doctors diagnosed him with end-stage renal disease. Doctors told Mosley he would get a kidney donation soon. But “soon” meant five to six years.“I would like to think you would do whatever they can for their friends,” Miller said. “I don’t feel like I’m a hero. This is who I am and this is how I was brought up.”“We’re family. We all get caught up in the fact that some people don’t associate with other people because of their race or what happened, but when it comes down to it, inside we’re all the same,” Mosley said. “One heart, two lungs, two kidneys. The more you learn and know, the more you grow as a person. That’s the diversity that makes us great.” 	TheBusinessJournal	Whitepages

"He actually kind of declared public warfare on his colleagues, I mean, just putting out missives, trashing them left and right."By spring 2015, the duo had alienated most of their colleagues. At the time Courser and Miller took office, Miller had been married to his wife for 18 years and Gamrat married her high school sweetheart, Joe Gamrat. Miller and Gamrat have childrenWhile in office, the two grew close. After late-night sessions at the State House in Lansing, the two would at times spend the night at the Radisson Hotel downtown instead of making the long drive home. The aides said Miller and Gamrat routinely shrugged off questions about how much time they spent together.	TheAdvocate	USSearch
3	vote3	Larry	Miller	Lure	Laptop	N18	Judicial candidate tied dog to roof of car	In June 2007 it was reported that in 2003, current judicial candidate Larry Miller had placed his Irish setter in a dog carrier on the roof of his station wagon for a 12-hour trip to his parents' cottage. He'd built a windshield for the carrier to make the ride more comfortable for the dog. He'd also made it clear to his children that bathroom breaks would be taken only during predetermined stops to gas up the car. The dog spoiled this plan by letting loose with a bout of diarrhea during its rooftop sojourn, necessitating an unplanned gas station visit for the purpose of hosing down the pooch, its carrier, and the back of the car.The car was barking the entire trip and apparently had shown signs of discomfort. Miller didn’t do anything to ease the dog’s problems and yelled at the entire family because of the unplanned stop.Animal rights organizations are disgusted with this news and are calling for the candidate to drop of out the race.Not only is the way he treated the dog in question, but also the way he reacted to the unplanned stop. Miller lashed out at his family for it; this makes people wonder if this type of behavior will be seen in the courtroom if elected.	TheTribune	PeopleGuide

But when one reporter strayed from the after-effects of the storm in asking a question, Miller fired back."Did I say on topic? Are you stupid? On topic, on topic. Next question," Miller, said, clearly angry at the question.According to ABC News video of the incident, the reporter asked if the judge was "going to be addressing state representatives" on Monday. Miller is in the midst of a tough re-election battle but he did not want to talk about it at the press conference over the weekend.Miller asked the group of reporters if they had any on topic questions before ending the press conference."Thank you all very much, and I'm sorry for the idiot over there.

Harris has new friends, on a terror list 	Judge Robert Harris is in a particularly tight re-election race this year, largely thanks to his bigoted remarks about gay people. Let's start with his new friends in domestic terrorism. Bloomberg BusinessWeek just revealed that Harris was the special guest at an event held by the fund-raising arm of the Oath Keepers — better known as a gang of paramilitary thugs who pointed their guns at federal agents in a tense, weeks-long standoff over a wildlife refuge. It's the same group whose founder charged in a speech that Sen. John McCain should be "hung by the neck until dead," for treason. Gov. Chris Christie's administration put the Oath Keepers on a list of domestic terror threats because of their increased fundraising and violent rhetoric. The Southern Poverty Law Center labels them dangerous extremists. But now we have Harris on video, calling a local Oath Keeper official an "unsung hero," and helping to raise the profile of his terrorist group. As if that weren't bad enough, the man Harris praised, Edward Durfee, also founded another group of 9/11 conspiracy theorists, some of whom believe the federal government was involved in that terror attack.  Harris has not renounced the Oath Keepers or his support for Durfee or done anything tangible to separate himself from the group. 	TheTribune	PeopleGuide

The Court of Appeal decision described Judge Harris’s behavior as "needlessly argumentative and rude". The judge has also been criticized for referring to a defendant and his co-accused as "pathetic drug addicts".In one heated exchange during the criminal trial Judge Harris called the defense lawyer's questions "stupid" three times, before simply calling him "stupid".At another point the judge observed the defense counsel had "a very unfortunate habit of asking a whole lot of unnecessary questions" and called one of his questions to a witness "incredibly stupid".This was in response to counsel's questioning of Nanopoulos about whether she had enjoyed jail.During the trial the judge worried aloud whether the accused would be able to get a fair trial. "I have become exasperated with [defense counsel's] incompetence, and I don't think Mr. Cook is getting a fair trial because of that"."It is not clear why the judge interrupted the cross-examination to ask the direct question about Alex Cook," the appeals judges note.At another point the appeal judges noted "the trial judge's interventions were unnecessary and risked undermining the course of cross-examination".The appeal judges also found it was unnecessary for the Judge Harris to repeatedly describe Cook and Nanopoulos as "pathetic", and at one occasion call them "pathetic drug addicts". However they found this did not affect the trial, as the comments were not made in the presence of the jury.	TheUnionTimes	PeopleSmart

It’s packed with boxes full of binders he’s donating to the school. “I work over at the courthouse,” Harris told the Business Journal. “When I do trials, afterwards all of the exhibit books are still there. I give the attorneys a chance to either say they want them or I tell them I will donate them to a local school. Almost all of them say go ahead and donate.”Harris has given hundreds of binders of all shapes and sizes to the local middle school over the years. “The proverbial idea just showed up. I thought, ‘What could we do with all of this? Who can benefit from it? We have more than enough that we can use.’”So he asked a friend, who is a uniformed patrol officer, to find a school in that could benefit from the binders. As it turns out, the patrol officer passed the information to a detective with the Police Department, who happened to be the husband of Middle School Principal Maria Pilar Perossio. The connection was made in 2011 and Klein has been bringing a carload of binders to the school about every six months ever since.	TheBusinessJournal	Whitepages

That means a store of funds for giving to charities far into the future."We've obviously been blessed. Part of what goes with that is a responsibility to be generous," said the Harris in an interview last week.Such foundations provide tax advantages to wealthy persons with philanthropic inclinations, according to Beverly Moran, a Vanderbilt University professor of law. "You and I do not get a deduction for money given to charity until it's actually given to the charity," she said.

He didn’t want others in similar situations to feel the way he did that day. “Moving into the dorms and unpacking all my stuff alone and seeing other people with their families ― it was tough for me because I would’ve loved to have my family there,” a teary-eyed Brown said in the video. “So that day, I vowed that I would help prevent people from having to move into the dorms alone.” So Brown did just that.Brown works with the support program Renaissance Scholars, who warmly greeted students in a room filled with college supplies. Others from the program were also there to help other former homeless or foster care students for the special day. In the video of Brown being recorded on a university’s move-in day, the students are clearly emotional when they check out the blankets, toiletries, notebooks and other items waiting for them. For the freshman, move-in day is particularly special because their dorm serves as the “first home that some of them have had,” Brown, who’s now working toward a master’s degree, explained in the video. 	TheReview	spokeo

4	vote4	Henry	Brown	Lure	Laptop	N26	Judge reprimanded for calling parents 'rotten,' 'stupid'	He called parents in his courtroom “rotten,” “stupid,” and in one case, a “total human disaster.”One woman’s daughter might as well begin “walking the streets as a hooker” because of the way her mother behaved in court, he told her.Those pointed comments, among others, were made by judge Henry Brown.Brown, who has been a judge for a few years now, presides over family court cases, which the commission recognized are “high-conflict” and “difficult.”Where Brown argued he was only using “blunt and evocative language” to drive home seriousness of the situations of those before him, the commission said he crossed the line.Much of the commission’s criticism was aimed at Brown’s comments during one specific case -- that of a mother accused of driving drunk in the middle of the night with her child in the car. Meanwhile, the child’s father was facing a criminal domestic violence case.“I just think, to be honest with you, sometimes people are just rotten, and they can’t respect other people. Everything’s drama, it’s like they’re trying out for Jersey Shore … Maybe what I should do is have CPS save your child from both of you because you are both rotten,” Brown said.In other instances, Brown warned people they’d be thrown in jail if he was “in the wrong mood” and mockingly said one "morbidly obese" father wasn’t going to get a job because he was "at risk of dying any time."

But let’s assume that maybe that didn’t work or something: I think there should be some punishment, but the punishment ought to be of the rapist, and not attacking the child.”The comments, made during an interview that was posted on Sunday, provoked howls of outrage from Democrats and women’s rights organizations. A state senator immediately took to Twitter with a blunt response. “As a woman & former prosecutor who handled 100s of rape cases,” she wrote, “I’m stunned by Brown’s comments about victims this AM.”	TheUnionTimes	PeopleSmart

By 16, she began taking OxyContin, which quickly led to a heroin addiction.  The high achieving high school student became homeless with a consistent address in jail, arrested for getting caught using drugs, charged with fifth-degree drug possession.“I thought alcohol was bad but heroin was worse, I needed it, I didn't have a choice anymore,” said Griffith.Heroin's grip did not stop even when she became pregnant, a new life growing inside her; innocent and already determined by the time she walked into Judge Keith Lewis’s courtroom. Griffith could have faced up to a year in prison, but Judge Lewis also had a choice. He brought her into court every few weeks under strict supervision, a new approach he often uses with young addicts and will continue to use when the drug court opens.Judge Lewis challenged her with small goals, staying sober and in treatment, beginning school, and looking for employment.“As a judge, you’ve got to be compassionate. Somebody like Jennifer Griffith comes in and is screaming for help. Addiction is a disease, its baby steps, its day by day, week by week,” said Judge Lewis.	TheReview	spokeo
