    <div id="bottom2"></div>

  <div id="main2">
    <p class="text">A Georgia police officer has bonded with a baby after saving her life.
    </p>
    <p class="text">On Saturday September 24, officer Kenneth Knox was dispatched to the Parham residence, where he found 
      a two-month-old baby choking and not breathing.
    </p>
    <p class="text">“I had fed her an hour prior to her choking,” mother Kristen Parham told FOX 5 Atlanta. “We were sitting 
      outside, in my car, and all of a sudden she started gasping for air and white stuff was coming out of her nose and mouth.”
    </p>
    <p class="text">Parham said the baby’s father jumped off the porch and attempted to save his daughter.
    </p>
    <p class="text">“We both didn’t know what to do, so I called 911,” Parham said.
    </p>
    <p class="text">According to her parents, Ma’Yavi was turning blue before Officer Knox arrived on the scene.
    </p>
    <p class="text">“He laid her on the couch and he did [reverse] CPR on her, and he sucked the cereal out of her throat,” Parham said.
    </p>
    <p class="text">The baby started breathing again, smiled at the officer, and started crying, which Knox described as “music to his ears” in a post on Facebook. 
      “Out of my 25 years being a cop, this is my greatest and most profound accomplishment,” he said. “It made every second of those 25 years worth it all. 
      I am forever humbled and changed by this.”
    </p>
    <p class="text">Parham asked Knox to be Ma’Yavi’s godfather a week later, and Knox responded “yes.”
    </p>
    <p class="text">“I know he is a great person and my baby will love him,” Parham told FOX 5 Atlanta. 
      “Every time she sees him, she gives him a big smile. I am grateful for him in my life and without him, 
      who knows what could’ve happened.”
    </p>
    <p class="text">Knox was honored to take on the role, calling Ma’Yavi his “angel” in a Facebook post.
    </p>
    <p class="text">“I can’t put it into words,” Knox told FOX 5 Atlanta. “She changed me forever.”

    <p id="title">The story of an Arkansas politician who gave away his adopted child, 
      and the tragedy that followed</p>
    <p id="reporter">CHRISTOPHER LEWIS, <i>Staff Writer</i> </p>
    <p id="date">NOVEMBER 6, 2016 | ARKANSAS</p>
  </div>
  
  <div id="main2">
    <p class="text">The sisters were supposed to be moving out of neglect and chaos and into the stability of 
      their forever home. For one of those girls, however, Arkansas Rep. Justin Harris’s house came to 
      represent something very different: a temporary stopping point on the way to some place much worse.
    </p>
    <p class="text">A series of stories by the Arkansas Times revealed that Harris put two young girls he adopted in 
      the care of a man who later sexually abused one of them.
    </p>
    <p class="text">More shocking still: What Harris did, unofficially giving away an adopted child, is not illegal 
      in Arkansas. It is known as “rehoming,” a name that describes a practice more common in pet adoption. 
      The practice is highly controversial — “a monstrous act,” according to adoption advocate John M. Simmons. 
      “There’s probably no greater trauma than thinking you have found a forever family and finding that’s not 
      the case,” said Sandy Santana, interim executive director of Children’s Rights.
    </p>
    <p class="text">Harris placed the blame on the state health services department, which, he said, refused to help. 
      State officials also did not act when they learned that the Harris’ had given the girls to another family, 
      according to the Times, until it was too late. Harris said after harming family pets and threats to hurt 
      the family including his three adopted sons, he again reached out to DHS for help, and where he said “we 
      were then threatened with possible abandonment charges and potentially losing our own boys,” Harris said. 
      So he took action and rehomed the girls to Stacey Francis, one of Mrs. Harris’ friends. Eric Francis 
      husband of Stacey, would later would be served forty years for raping one of the girls while she was out 
      of town. Adoption advocates are trying to outlaw rehoming in all states to avoid these events from occurring.

    <p>CHAMPAIGN– To raise awareness about the importance of community food pantries and soup kitchens, Senator Scott Bennett (D-Champaign) will be 
       serving lunch at the Daily Bread Soup Kitchen. This isn’t a first time occurrence for Senator Bennett. He often attends the Daily Bread Soup 
       kitchen to provide whatever help is necessary. Senator Bennett said, “I realize I have been blessed in my life, and this is just one way for me 
       to give back to my community.”</p>
    
    <p>Bennett is currently participating in the SNAP Challenge to experience what life is like for millions of low-income Americans living on an average
       daily allowance of $4.40. However, often due to stigma surrounding soup kitchens, many Americans don’t often seek out the help they can receive due 
       to pride or other personal reasons. Senator Bennett advocates on a large scale to other communities to reduce this stigma as it is there to benefit 
       all those in need of a hot meal. Regardless of the stigma, with the recent market and prices of food and gas ever increasing, more and more Americans 
       are relying on soup kitchens to provide nourishment for their day. Senator Bennett said “many of our neighbors are experiencing difficult times and 
       rely on area soup kitchens to receive a decent meal.” Even with all of Senator Bennett’s effort, due to the budget impasse, soup kitchens in Champaign-Urbana 
       area are left no choice but to close their doors. The Daily Bread Soup Kitchen will be attempting to serve additional families without additional funding. 
       This news comes in light of the Daily Bread Soup Kitchen’s recent purchase of a new facility to allow them to serve more residents. However, they still need 
       to raise $300,000 for renovation costs. Senator Bennett is looking into setting up a fundraiser to help diminish the costs. </p>

    <p id="title">Gov. Bill Haslam donating $4.5 million per year to charitable foundations
</p>
    <p id="reporter"> By: MAGGIE HAMILTON &nbsp<span style="color:gray;font-style:italic;" >Nov. 5</span></p>
    <p id="date"></p>
    <div id="bottom2"></div>
  </div>
  
  <div id="main2">
    <p class="text">NASHVILLE — Over a 10-year period, Bill Haslam has contributed more than $45 million to two 
      charitable foundations that, in turn, have donated almost $25 million to hundreds of organizations promoting 
      education, religion and culture.
    </p>
    <p class="text">The average of $4.5 million per year in combined donations to Charis Foundation, established 
      by Haslam and his wife in 2001, and the Haslam Family Foundation, established by his father in 1998, dwarfs 
      the $690,000 in average annual charitable giving separately reported by Haslam as a candidate for governor 
      two years ago.
    </p>
    <p class="text">Combined, the two foundations have accumulated about $100 million in assets through Haslam 
      donations and investing. That means a store of funds for giving to charities far into the future.
    </p>
    <p class="text">"We've obviously been blessed. Part of what goes with that is a responsibility to be generous," 
      said the Haslam in an interview last week.  
    </p>
    <p class="text">Such foundations provide tax advantages to wealthy persons with philanthropic inclinations, 
      according to Beverly Moran, a Vanderbilt University professor of law. "You and I do not get a deduction 
      for money given to charity until it's actually given to the charity," she said. "One of the big advantages 
      of a foundation is that you can get a deduction now for the donation you're going to make later." "You can 
      take the monies you do not need at the moment, but have decided where to put it, and get the tax deduction 
      now," she said. "We never give for tax purposes. We give for the purpose of giving," Jim Haslam said. 
      "Natalie (his wife) and I feel very strongly we have an obligation to give back to the community. 
      Once we pass on, we want to be able to perpetuate our giving back to the community," said the senior Haslam, 
      founder of a family-owned chain of gas stations and travel centers.
