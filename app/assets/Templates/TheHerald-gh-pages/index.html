    On Saturday September 24, officer Kenneth Knox was dispatched to the Parham residence, where he found 
      a two-month-old baby choking and not breathing.<br><br>
    “I had fed her an hour prior to her choking,” mother Kristen Parham told FOX 5 Atlanta. “We were sitting 
      outside, in my car, and all of a sudden she started gasping for air and white stuff was coming out of her nose and mouth.”<br><br>
    Parham said the baby’s father jumped off the porch and attempted to save his daughter.<br><br>
    “We both didn’t know what to do, so I called 911,” Parham said.<br><br>
   According to her parents, Ma’Yavi was turning blue before Officer Knox arrived on the scene.<br><br>
    “He laid her on the couch and he did [reverse] CPR on her, and he sucked the cereal out of her throat,” Parham said.<br><br>
    The baby started breathing again, smiled at the officer, and started crying, which Knox described as “music to his ears” in a post on Facebook. 
      “Out of my 25 years being a cop, this is my greatest and most profound accomplishment,” he said. “It made every second of those 25 years worth it all. 
      I am forever humbled and changed by this.”<br><br>
    Parham asked Knox to be Ma’Yavi’s godfather a week later, and Knox responded “yes.”<br><br>
    “I know he is a great person and my baby will love him,” Parham told FOX 5 Atlanta. 
      “Every time she sees him, she gives him a big smile. I am grateful for him in my life and without him, 
      who knows what could’ve happened.”<br><br>
    Knox was honored to take on the role, calling Ma’Yavi his “angel” in a Facebook post.<br><br>
    “I can’t put it into words,” Knox told FOX 5 Atlanta. “She changed me forever.”<br><br>
